        The success of a new product is to a large extent due to
        whether the producer making efficient and accurate strategies
        between the different stages of a product lifecycle.  Big Data
        analytic techniques have the potential to improve the
        efficiency of product development, making accurate product
        strategy, channel strategy, pricing strategies and promotional
        strategies in the different period of a product lifecycle.  In
        this project, I will try to figure out how the data affect the
        decision making and try to use decision trees and PageRank to
        making classification and produce a good market segmentation
        and market positioning for a product.
